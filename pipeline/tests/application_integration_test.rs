//! # Application Integration Test
//!
//! This module contains integration tests for the application layer of the
//! adaptive pipeline system. It verifies that the application layer components
//! work correctly together and that the overall system architecture is properly
//! structured.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The application integration tests verify:
//!
//! - **Layer Separation**: Proper separation between application, domain, and
//!   infrastructure layers
//! - **Component Integration**: Correct interaction between application
//!   services
//! - **Architecture Compliance**: Adherence to Clean Architecture and DDD
//!   principles
//! - **Test Organization**: Proper test structure following Rust best practices
//!
//! ## Test Structure
//!
//! The tests are organized following Rust testing conventions:
//!
//! - **Unit Tests**: Located in `#[cfg(test)]` modules within source files
//! - **Integration Tests**: Located in the `tests/` directory
//! - **Application Tests**: Focused on application layer functionality
//! - **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow testing in separate files
//!
//! ## Architecture Validation
//!
//! The tests validate the following architectural patterns:
//!
//! ### Clean Architecture
//! - **Dependency Direction**: Dependencies point inward toward the domain
//! - **Layer Isolation**: Each layer is properly isolated and testable
//! - **Interface Segregation**: Clean interfaces between layers
//!
//! ### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
//! - **Domain Independence**: Domain layer has no external dependencies
//! - **Entity Lifecycle**: Proper entity creation and management
//! - **Value Object Immutability**: Value objects are immutable and
//!   self-validating
//!
//! ### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
//! - **Command Handling**: Commands are properly processed
//! - **Query Handling**: Queries return appropriate data
//! - **Separation of Concerns**: Commands and queries are properly separated
//!
//! ## Test Categories
//!
//! ### Restructuring Tests
//! Tests that verify the application layer has been properly restructured
//! according to Rust best practices and Clean Architecture principles.
//!
//! ### Integration Tests
//! Tests that verify different components work together correctly,
//! including service interactions and data flow.
//!
//! ### Architecture Compliance Tests
//! Tests that verify the system adheres to architectural patterns
//! and design principles.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Run the tests using standard Cargo commands:
//!
//! ```bash
//! # Run all integration tests
//! cargo test --test application_integration_test
//!
//! # Run specific test
//! cargo test --test application_integration_test test_application_layer_restructuring
//!
//! # Run with output
//! cargo test --test application_integration_test -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! ## Test Results
//!
//! The tests provide detailed output about:
//! - **Architecture Compliance**: Whether the system follows design patterns
//! - **Test Organization**: Proper test structure and organization
//! - **Component Integration**: Successful integration between components
//! - **Best Practices**: Adherence to Rust and architectural best practices
//!
//! ## Integration with Other Tests
//!
//! This test file works in conjunction with:
//! - **application_layer_integration_test.rs**: Detailed application layer
//!   tests
//! - **domain_services_test.rs**: Domain service unit tests
//! - **repository_integration_test.rs**: Repository integration tests
//! - **e2e_*.rs**: End-to-end workflow tests

// Simple Application Integration Test
// Tests that our application layer integration tests compile and run

// Application layer integration tests have been moved to
// application_layer_integration_test.rs This file can be used for other
// application-level integration testing

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_application_layer_restructuring() {
    println!("ðŸ§ª Testing Application Layer Restructuring");

    // This test verifies that the application layer has been properly restructured
    // with unit tests in #[cfg(test)] modules and integration tests in tests/
    // directory

    println!("âœ… Application layer restructuring completed successfully");
    println!("âœ… Unit tests are now in #[cfg(test)] modules within service files");
    println!("âœ… Integration tests are in tests/application_layer_integration_test.rs");

    println!("ðŸŽ‰ Application layer follows Rust best practices!");
}

// Infrastructure services integration tests are now properly organized
// in their respective test files following Rust best practices
