## Purpose

This document defines the scope and boundaries for the Optimized Adaptive Pipeline documentation to ensure we maintain a **reasonable, sustainable, and valuable** documentation set.

## Guiding Principle

**"Reasonable"** - Our documentation should be:
- Professional enough for open-source release
- Educational enough to demonstrate advanced Rust concepts
- Comprehensive enough to be useful
- **Maintainable enough to keep current**

We are NOT creating:
- ❌ An exhaustive treatise on architecture patterns
- ❌ A complete Rust programming textbook
- ❌ Academic research documentation
- ❌ Marketing materials

We ARE creating:
- ✅ Clear, practical documentation for developers
- ✅ Educational examples of advanced Rust patterns
- ✅ Professional-grade technical documentation
- ✅ Enough detail to understand and extend the system

## Scope Boundaries

### IN SCOPE

#### Code Documentation (Rustdoc)
- **What it does** - Clear, concise description (1-3 sentences)
- **Arguments** - Parameter descriptions
- **Returns** - Return value description
- **Errors** - When/why it fails
- **Examples** - Minimal, focused example
- **Limit:** ~20-40 lines per item

**OUT:** Architecture explanations, design rationale, extensive tutorials

#### Main Documentation Book (`docs/`)
- Getting started guide
- High-level architecture overview (1-2 pages)
- Workspace structure explanation
- Contributing guidelines
- **Limit:** ~15-20 pages total

**OUT:** Detailed implementation guides, algorithm deep-dives

#### Pipeline Documentation Book (`pipeline/docs/`)

**Fundamentals** (3-5 chapters)
- What is a pipeline
- Basic usage
- Configuration overview

**Architecture** (4-6 chapters)
- Domain model overview
- Layered design explanation
- Dependency inversion with examples
- Repository pattern

**Implementation** (5-7 chapters)
- Stage processing
- Compression/encryption high-level
- Data persistence
- Metrics/observability

**Advanced Topics** (3-4 chapters)
- Concurrency model
- Performance considerations
- Extending the pipeline

**Limit:** ~40-50 pages total

**OUT:** Exhaustive algorithm explanations, line-by-line code walkthroughs

#### Formal Documentation

**SRS** (10-15 pages)
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- System interfaces
- Traceability matrix

**SDD** (15-20 pages)
- Architecture overview with diagrams
- Component design
- Key design decisions with rationale
- Technology choices

**STP** (5-8 pages)
- Test strategy overview
- Coverage approach
- Test categories (unit, integration, e2e)

**Limit:** ~35-40 pages total for all formal docs

**OUT:** Detailed test cases, exhaustive requirements analysis

#### Diagrams
- **10-15 core diagrams** covering:
  - Architecture layers
  - Component interactions
  - Data flows
  - Domain model
  - Key sequences

**Limit:** Keep diagrams simple and focused

**OUT:** Diagram for every class/function, overly complex diagrams

---

### OUT OF SCOPE

1. **Line-by-line code explanations** - Code should be self-explanatory
2. **Rust language tutorials** - Reference official Rust docs
3. **Third-party library documentation** - Reference their docs
4. **Exhaustive algorithm details** - High-level explanation sufficient
5. **Marketing/sales content** - This is technical documentation
6. **Meeting notes, decision logs** - Keep separate if needed
7. **Operational runbooks** - Not applicable for this project
8. **API versioning docs** - Pre-1.0, not needed yet

---

## Quality Standards

### Documentation Must Be:

1. **Accurate** - Reflects actual implementation
2. **Current** - Updated when code changes
3. **Concise** - No unnecessary verbosity
4. **Clear** - Understandable to target audience
5. **Professional** - Proper grammar, formatting, structure

### Target Audiences (in order of priority):

1. **Experienced Rust developers** learning advanced patterns
2. **Contributors** wanting to extend the pipeline
3. **Intermediate Rust developers** studying architecture
4. **Students/learners** exploring DDD/Clean/Hexagonal patterns

### What "Reasonable" Means:

- **Time:** Each chapter takes 2-4 hours to write (not 2 days)
- **Length:** Chapters are 2-5 pages (not 20 pages)
- **Maintenance:** Can be updated in <1 hour when code changes
- **Value:** Answers common questions, saves developer time

---

## Review Criteria

Before committing documentation, ask:

1. ✅ Is this necessary for understanding the system?
2. ✅ Would a developer need this to contribute?
3. ✅ Does this demonstrate an advanced Rust/architecture concept?
4. ✅ Can we maintain this as code evolves?
5. ✅ Is this the right place for this information?

If 3+ answers are "no", reconsider the documentation.

---

## Success Metrics

Good documentation helps developers:
- ✅ Understand the architecture in <30 minutes
- ✅ Make their first contribution in <2 hours
- ✅ Understand advanced patterns through concrete examples
- ✅ Find answers without asking questions

---

## Maintenance Commitment

- **Major refactors:** Update affected docs in same PR
- **New features:** Add minimal docs (what/why, not how)
- **Quarterly review:** Check for outdated information
- **Keep or kill:** If docs aren't being used, remove them

---

## Decision Authority

When scope questions arise:
1. Default to **less** documentation rather than more
2. Favor **code clarity** over extensive documentation
3. Ask: "Would Rust core team document this way?"
4. Remember: We can always add more later
