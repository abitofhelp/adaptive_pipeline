## Welcome

Welcome to the **Adaptive Pipeline** documentation. This project is a high-performance, educational file processing pipeline built in Rust, demonstrating advanced software architecture patterns and modern Rust idioms.

## What is This Project?

The Adaptive Pipeline is:

- **A File Processing System** - Transform files through configurable stages (compression, encryption, integrity checking)
- **An Educational Resource** - Learn advanced Rust patterns, DDD, Clean Architecture, and Hexagonal Architecture
- **Open Source** - Licensed under BSD-3-Clause, contributions welcome

## Who is This For?

- **Rust Developers** learning advanced patterns
- **Contributors** wanting to extend the pipeline
- **Students** exploring software architecture
- **Engineers** seeking secure file processing solutions
